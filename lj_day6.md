<h1>201 Day 5</h1>
<p>Day 5 was tremendous. I'm glad that I had a good night's sleep and got to class early. Especially considering how tough the lab was. I learned about how to generate html content through javascript objects. I also learned that yes- I can triumph- through the power of snacking.
Something that finally stuck once I started the lab was syntax on variables within an object.</p>
