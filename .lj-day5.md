<h1>Code 201 Day 5 </h1>
<p> Today I've learned the importance of snacks during class. It was interesting to learn about singling out items from an array and then cycling them into a function. I'm not confident at all on branching. I thought I had a good grasp on it, until I was in my group. Day 5 was kind of a frustrating wash for me. I had the beginnings of a nasty migraine by the time lecture ended- and then felt like I was going to vomit for most of the short time I was useless in lab. Day 5 just sort of sucked from start to finish. I was so sick that when I left I knew I wouldn't be able to complete any of the assignments due that day by midnight- which left me feeling really pissed off this morning when I woke up. 

Since then, I've calmed down a bit and am reviewing git through various videos and will take some time to finish my about me project and then restart the function challenges. Even if I couldn't contribute to the group- I still want to put in the time to solve them. I've come to see our time solving problems- akin to acheiving an elite level of fitness. Noone pushes their fitness with the same easy routines motions, or lifts. You have to go out of your comfort- and as one of the assigned articles explained- you should be exhausted at the end of that deliberate practice- not unlike a great workout.

My goals for the upcoming week are to complete each assignment - each day- and put in some extra time to write out cheat notes so that I can review them on the bus ride home. I also want to complete all of the readings ahead of time and take notes- so that I can spend more time focusing on practicing programming during the week. This will allow for a more efficient time management, since understanding concepts isn't hard- making them work in code is.
