<h1>Day 8</h1>
<p> Today I learned that I am most definitely in the weeds and need to take a step back to review the basics and then reapproach this lab. Although the overall concepts make sense- actually executing them- I have some holes that need to be filled in. I'm still confused by all of the jargon that concerns an object. Some terms are starting to make sense, i.e. this. At first I thought that the meaning was similar to how it is used in jquery- it is and it's not. :S. I'm not even going to bother with the event Listners until I get this first part done. Feeling kinda blabla as in my head is made of jello. I'm hoping this feeling will pass soon.</p>
