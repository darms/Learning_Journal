<h1>Day 13</h1>
<p>Yesterday was mindblowing. I'm still not 100% on the concept
of local storage. We were able to get everything to work, but certain parts of it still mystify me. Stingifying elements and then de stringifying them to render made sense- but understanding exactly where to put them and why- isn't 110% yet. Thus, I'm going to reread the articles and go into class early this morning to have a few more questions answered. If this is possible- I'm simultaneously
feel I understand loads more than I did when I started this class, but am just
as in the dark about newer concepts that were introduced. I feel queasy about
starting the quizzes. </p>
