<h1>201 day10</h1>
<p> Today I learned how to take basic sketches and think about coding the wireframes. Previously, I've always sketched out
wireframes or created them with illustrator to show. Creating a dynamic document that conveys the same information
while providing a skeletal html structure makes more sense. I will be implementing this with all of my freelancing
projects moving forward. Learning about using place holder images- and that there are generators was also super neat.
I like that the kitty filler photos. It would be fun to prank someone with that- how I'm not sure- but I will work out the details later.
As for coding- I finally was able to get the sales table to render to the page. Now I just need to finish styling it and-woohoo! Day 2 of this past week will be done.
For the most part- I'm starting to feel more solid about what I've learned. I'm more proud of myself for going slowly and getting it- rather than racing ahead and not understanding/mastering any of the trouble shooting required.
Also as far as trouble shooting goes- it was way cool to hear about using keywords in javascript to get the bugs to reveal themselves to you, i.e. debugger. I'm going to read the chapter on debugging tonight and practice using catch, etc.
Also- I've come to find out- that by showing up everyday-no matter how I feel I'm doing- and just doing my best to move forward- has been instrumental to not giving up. Not to mention that I don't want to go back to working in a call center, and lying to relatives about what I do for work for years on end. :S. Yeah, I'm happy to bust my butt and leave that behind. Fingers crossed, I'll learn just as much this weekend and I finish catching up on labs and reviewing. </p>
