<h1>Code201 LJ Day Three</h1>
<p>Today we covered a lot of ground. I wish we had spent more time going over the javascript in the morning rather than squeezed in at the end before breaking. I liked learning about parseInt. I will be using that to complete the lab for today in setting up question 6. When we initially ask a user a number question, and they respond with a number, it's actually converted to a string. Thus, we learned how to convert it back from a string so that it would work this time around. I'm looking forward to being able to better format my code and have all of the questions and answers live in 2 different arrays that are cycled through. That's my ultimate end goal for all of the quesitons that we are completing on this challenge. </p>
