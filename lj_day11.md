<h1>Day 11</h1>
<p> Today was shockingly productive. I stayed home to review event handlers and finish up
some work on that. I also spent some time reading over the new lab- and writing user stories.
I just finished watching the new assignment- a TED talk "How to Stop Screwing Yourself Over".
A lot of her advice rang true. Especially the part about- there will never be a time
when you feel like it- so you need to disregard your feelings about it and just do it.
I'll do my best to start implementing that with coding. One of my weak spots is that I can go
a little slow- while I try to pick up the meaning behind everything. I'm coming to find that
just keeping up is more than enough. My fingers are crossed that this somehow either makes
more sense or gets a little easier.</p>
