<h1>Day 15</h1>
<p>Today I learned about the differences between a function declaration and an expression. Function declarations can be placed anywhere in the code and will run just fine. However, an expression will not work if you place it an try to call it before t's defined - it won't work. This has a higher fail rate- but it takes less memory than regular function declarations. however down the line, when working on enterprise level sofware writing expressions would make more sense. This is because it takes less memory and can run code faster.</p>
<p> Another really intersting topic that was covereed and left me needing more of a review was prototypes. Juan had a brilliant observation- that prototypes of objects are like DNA and the object is the offspring. I'm going to rewatch the class lecture again so I can better make sense of using prototypes. It makes sense- but I'm still shaky on actually executing them. Hopefully this will change in the very near future.</p>
